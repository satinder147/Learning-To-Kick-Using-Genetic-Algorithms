# Learning-To-Kick-Using-Genetic-Algorithms
In this project I have used genetic algorithms to teach a robotic leg to kick a football(ping pong ball). There are 4 such legs representing a population. The decisions which lead to the greatest fitness value are forwarded to the children. Fitness is the distance the ball travels after it is kicked.
